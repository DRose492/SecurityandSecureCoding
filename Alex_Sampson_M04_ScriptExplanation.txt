This script helps protect your information by making sure it stays private, unchanged, and easy to access when needed. It keeps things private by scrambling your message using a strong lock called ChaCha20, so only someone with the right key can read it. That key is made using computer-generated randomness, kind of like rolling a bunch of dice, which makes it nearly impossible for someone to guess. To make sure your message hasn’t been changed, the script creates a digital fingerprint using something called SHA-256. If even one letter is different, the fingerprint won’t match. It also lets you sign your message digitally, so others can confirm it really came from you and wasn’t tampered with. Finally, the script is built to be easy to use—it checks that everything is ready before it runs and gives you simple options to choose from, so you can hash, encrypt, or sign your message without needing to be a tech expert. All of this works together to keep your data safe, trustworthy, and available when you need it.
